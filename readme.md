# Dice game

Nice and simple dice game developed during my software development course at Code Nation.
It is a very fun game that can be played with friends or even use it to teach kids how to sum numbers. 


## Rules for the game

So, the rules are very simple. You can set the maximum score or play it with 50 points by default.
If the player rolls dice number 1, the player loses his points and the next player starts his turn.
To keep the points, the player needs to press the Hold button. 
If the player presses the hold button when it reaches the maximum points, the player wins.

### What I liked

It was very challenging for me during this project. I really like to work this process where I could practice everything that I learned during my first 3 weeks in the course. Applying HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to make it functional was amazing.

### What I need to look into more

In the future, I would like to make it possible to add more players and have an online version.
